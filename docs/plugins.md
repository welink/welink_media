Plugins
======================

Here you will find a list of plugins/modules most known and used by the open source community and/or private companies.

Our goal is to filter them down to the best and most useful ones, keep in mind that plugins with too much or even any DOM manipulation outside of the React environment may not be accepted to be part of the list.


### Prerequisite

- The plugin must have active work/maintenance by the author/community.
- The plugin should **NOT** manipulate the DOM directly (outside of React environment).
- Don't get to attached to the list, make sure to choose the best options for your project.

### How to use

The plugin/module should be part of the dependencies

```ruby
npm install plugin --save
```
